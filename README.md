# Primer Design Tool

This tool designs primers for given DNA sequences based on specified principles. It generates two sets of primers for each input sequence and provides detailed information about each primer.

## Features

- Designs primers based on length, melting temperature, GC content, secondary structures, and 3' end specificity.
- Generates two sets of primers for each input sequence.
- Provides detailed information about each primer, including length, GC content, melting temperature, and scores for secondary structures and 3' end specificity.

## Usage

1. Place your input file (`Primers_Output.txt`) in the `data` directory.
2. Run the `primer_design.py` script.
3. The output will be saved in `Primer_Design_Output.txt` and `Additional_Primer_Design_Output.txt`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
